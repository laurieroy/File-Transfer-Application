# [File Transfer App using Tkinter (GUI) SQLite3 (DB)](../../../Tech-Acad-Projects/python/files24_main.pyw)
Python application using a GUI interface, to specify file type, age and directories. Time of transfer stored in a database

Written and tested in Python 3.6, SQLite3 on a PC/Win7 as a drill for the python course at the Tech Academy, September 2017, Portland OR

Use Python and Tkinter to build a desktop application with both GUI and 
database functionality. This project increased in complexity over [several 
applications],(https://github.com/laurieroy/Tech-Acad-Projects/tree/master/python) evolving from comparing time to transferring files from one location on a computer to another, to adding in a GUI interface and database functionality. The user selects file type (default: .txt), file age (default: 24 hrs), source and destination directories. 

Requirements:

* create a database and a table
* modify your script to both record date/time of 'file check' runs and to retrieve that data for use in the 'file check' process 
* modify the UI (Tkinter) to display the last 'file check' date/time 

I expanded on the assignment, allowing the user to select file type and file age, instead of hardcoding in 24 hrs and .txt files. Added defaults and clear buttons as a starting case. I also added in stoplight color coding for the non-color-blind.
