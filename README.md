# [File Transfer App using Tkinter (GUI) SQLite3 (DB)](/Tech-Acad-Projects/blob/master/python/files24_main.pyw)
Python application using a GUI interface, to specify file type, age and directories. Time of transfer stored in a database

Written and tested in Python 3.6, SQLite3 on a PC/Win7 as a drill for the python course at the Tech Academy, September 2017, Portland OR

This project was the culmination of [6 drills](https://github.com/laurieroy/Tech-Acad-Projects/tree/master/python) that progressively gained complexity, adding in a GUI and database. The user selects file type (default: .txt), file age (default: 24 hrs), source and destination directories. 

Requirements:

* create a database and a table
* modify your script to both record date/time of 'file check' runs and to retrieve that data for use in the 'file check' process 
* modify the UI (Tkinter) to display the last 'file check' date/time 
I added in the functionality of choosing the file type and file age.
